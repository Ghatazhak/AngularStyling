# Elements

For small elements, there is the `elements/` folder. While `layout/` is macro (defining the global wireframe), `elements/` is more focused on widgets. It contains all kind of specific modules like a slider, a loader, a widget, and basically anything along those lines. There are usually a lot of files in elements/ since the whole site/application should be mostly composed of tiny modules.
