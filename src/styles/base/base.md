# Base

The `base` folder contains the foundational styles for the project. These styles apply basic styling rules to elements and provide a consistent base for other styles to build upon.

## Contents

- **_reset.scss**: Include a CSS reset to remove browser-specific styling.
- **_normalize.scss**: Include styles to ensure consistency across different browsers.
- **_typography.scss**: Define base typography rules, such as font-family, font-size, line-height, etc.
- **_base.scss**: Apply base styles to HTML elements (e.g., `body`, `h1`, `p`, etc.).
- **_index.scss**: Use `@forward` to forward all files in this folder.

These styles should be minimal and provide a clean slate for further styling.
