# Layout

The `layout` folder contains styles related to the layout and structure of the application. These styles help define the overall layout and positioning of elements.

## Contents

- **_grid.scss**: Define the grid system for layout structure.
- **_header.scss**: Styles for the header section.
- **_footer.scss**: Styles for the footer section.
- **_sidebar.scss**: Styles for sidebars.
- **_main.scss**: Styles for the main content area.
- **_index.scss**: Use `@forward` to forward all files in this folder.

These styles should focus on the structure and arrangement of elements rather than their appearance.
